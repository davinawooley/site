                Our goal was to develop a digital tool to help individuals improve their dog training skills by more closely aligning their
                 understandings of dog cognition with those of professional trainers. 
                <br><br>Our design is grounded in qualitative data collected through semi-structured interviews.

            • How does a trainer's understanding of dog cognition contribute their effectiveness?
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspo How do novice/intermediate trainers approach a training task as opposed to a professional
             trainer?

            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspo What distinguishes a novice/intermediate trainer from a professional trainer in terms of why
             they train dogs the way they do?

            <p id="bioBody">
        
            In this stage of data collection, we conducted virtual semi-structured interviews (30-60 minutes each) with six participants across a 
            variety of experience levels of dog training. 
            <br><br>• One participant is a Certified Professional Dog Trainer-Knowledge Assessed 
            (CPDT-KA).
            <br>• Two participants are researchers who have worked in dog-related cognitibe research and have experience training dogs for research.
            <br>• Final three participants are dog owners who have done some informal training with their dogs at home.

<h1 id="sectionHead">Findings</h1>
<p id="bioBody"> 
        
Our affinity mapping process yields some key insights into aligning dog owners’ cognitive processes with those of professional dog trainers. 
<br><br>
</p>
<div id="tabbed">
<h1 id="sectionHead">Successful Amateur</h1>
<p id="bioBody"> 
Participants with successful prior experience in training dogs discussed how understanding conditioning approaches (such as operant and classical
 conditioning) assisted in effective training. In addition, successful trainers emphasized understanding dog body language and structuring 
 personalized training regimens.
 <br> <br>
</p>
</div>
<div id="tabbed">
<h1 id="sectionHead">Unsuccessful Amateur</h1>
<p id="bioBody"> 
From our interviews with dog owners who were not successful in training their dogs, we gathered that many of them could not tell why their dog 
was doing what it was doing. <br><br> Or if their actions had any direct impact on the dog. <br><br> They also expressed that during training, 
they were uncertain as to whether the dog was learning or if their feedback was effective. <br><br> The owners did not have an accurate 
representation of the dog’s behaviors and could not accurately map those behaviors to emotional states. Because of this, the owners believed that
 their work was in vain deterred them from future training efforts. <br><br>
 </p>
</div>
<div id="tabbed">

 <h1 id="sectionHead">Experienced Professional</h1>
<p id="bioBody"> 
 More experienced dog trainers mentioned that this fundamental misunderstanding of canine body language can lead to high distress for both the dog
 and the trainer. <br><br> This finding is important to note so that we can include common dog behaviors and stressors for trainers to avoid 
 implementing.
<br><br>Dog owners who struggled with training expressed that their dogs would behave well when in low-stimulus environments but would appear 
to ignore or forget their training in high-stimulus environments. This finding is important for our deliverable so that we can implement a way to
check environmental controls.
</p>
</div>

<h1 id="sectionHead">Conclusion</h1>
<p id="bioBody"> 
    • Effective dog training fundamentally relies on effective communication and consistency.
<br><br>• Struggling dog trainers should first identify what
 motivates their dog (treats, toys, affection, etc.) and understanding a dog’s body language.

 <br><br>• Dog behavior is predictable based on the stimuli offered and the motivating goal or reward.

</p>


<h1 id="sectionHead">Prototype Implementation</h1>
<p id="bioBody">
“Dognitive Science”, is a mobile application prototype that created using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD. All design
  decisions were influenced by key insights obtained from our interviews.
</p>

<h1 id="sectionHead">Validation Plan</h1>
<p id="bioBody">
We recruited dog owners that were not professional dog trainers to test our prototype.
<br><br>We conducted cognitive walkthroughs with each participant to identify design weaknesses and to determine whether or not the app is usable.
The task will require users to teach the dog to learn how to sit. Mainly, we want to see if the user can glean useful information from the training tool. 
<br><br>At the end of the test, we will ask the participant the following questions:

<br><br><b>Based on initial test, we were able to:</b><br>
1) improve upon the usability and design of our app
<br>2) understand if the tool is working as intended.

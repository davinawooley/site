                        Hiking is an excellent activity that presents a unique opportunity for individuals to exercise, enjoy nature, socialize, and take a mental break from the chaos of everyday life. 
                        The goal was to create a product that decreases the users' logistical concerns, allowing them to focus on the hike more than the planning, scheduling, coordinating and communicatiion.

    ● What additional activities do you like to participate in while on a hiking trip?
            <br><br>● How often do you hike throughout the year, and what factors motivate your decisions?
            <br><br>● Approximately how many hiking trips do you schedule and cancel each year? Why?
            <br><br>● What are the factors used to determine which trail you choose? (eg. location, difficulty, trail completion time, views, landmarks, etc.)
            <br><br>● Do you prefer to hike solo or in a group?
            <br><br>● How do you coordinate hiking trips and what are some of the challenges you've experienced? </p>
        
        <h1 id="sectionHead">Data-Driven Insight</h1>

        <p id="bioBody"> One individual interviewed has a friendly competition with a friend relating to tracking their physical activity, so we could see competition being a small factor for some users. 
            <br><br>● 78% of  interviewees did not like using their phones during hikes.
            <br><br>● A few people liked to track their steps and calories on the trail.
            <br><br>● Everyone liked hiking with at least a small group of friends.
            <br><br>● All interviewees stated that they like to hike because they want to spend time outdoors.

        <p id="bioBody">
            <b>Convenience</b> - Users want to find trails that are nearby, easily accessible, and trails that meet their requirements (difficulty, trail length, river, etc ). 
            <br><br><b>Seclusion</b> - Hikers do not mind using technology in preparation for their hike. However, when on the trail they like to use technology minimally or ubiquitously. They want to be "in the moment" and "aware of their surroundings."
            <br><br><b>Community</b> - Hikers strongly prefer bonding and sharing unique outdoor experiences with others. 
            <br><br><b>Safety</b> - Some users were very invested in ensuring that their prospective trails were low-risk and that in case of an emergency they will be able to receive assistance.

        <p id="bioBody">
            There were two 45 minute-long ideation sessions that produced 110 ideas. The objectice was to come up with as many judgement free ideas inspired by the design criteria as possible.

        <h1 id="sectionHead">Idea Selection</h1>
        <div id="shortBio">
        <p id="bioBody">
            To select the final design concept, I looked at the ideas generated, and analyzed them in terms of whether the concept meets design criteria and what has the potential to meet market/user needs.
            <u>Community</u> was the most importand design criteria, as determined from the data.
            <br> <br> After creating the ideas I separated them into main categories. Green sticky notes indicate the most relevant categories, and the blue sticky notes beneath
            highlight the most relevant ideas. Finally, it was concluded that planning a group hiking event and finding people to join you in your hike, satisfied our design requirements and met unsatisfied needs.
            <br> <br> Finally, the idea for HikeHerd was born and I began outlining features inspired by findings and began prototyping concepts.

          <b>Focus on Community and Convenience</b> - Our interviewees liked the social aspects of hiking but struggle with planning hikes. This website will provide features to the user to help them plan and obtain information regarding their
            hike in a centralized location.

            <br><br><b>Users</b> - The most relevant users would be enthusiastic hikers looking to hike with groups of individuals. Primarily this appeals to our John Brooks persona. Our target demographic consists of enthusiastic hikers 25-50.
